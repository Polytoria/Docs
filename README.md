# Revamped Polytoria Documentation

This is a fork of the new-docs branch on the Polytoria Scripting Documentation GitHub repository. That branch has been unmaintained for a while so this is a maintained version as it would be a shame to let such an improved documentation experience just collect dust. We hope to have all of this documentation filled out soon.

## To-do Changes

- [ ] Adding context to "Developer for other platforms?" link on homepage which was included on the original design but we have no idea what it means or would link to
- [ ] Document "RemoteEvents" (removed in recent Polytoria client and creator versions; replaced with "Network Events")
- [ ] Add a "Removed Classes" page for deprecated/removed classes in recent Polytoria client and creator versions
- [ ] Re-order navbar in order of importance rather than alphabetically

## Possible Changes

- [ ] "Home" link on navbar instead of clicking on the logo/site name to go to homepage
- [ ] Darker theme colors to connect the homepage and the rest of the site design
- [ ] Listing all inherited events, properties, and methods in brackets next to the "Inherits (class name)" text
- [ ] Search page for fetching pages instead of having lists for every class name in each category
- [ ] Embed theme color matching category of object (eg. Enum=Orange, Purple=Service, etc)
- [ ] Renaming "Projects" -> "Demos"
- [ ] Deploying to Vercel to avoid GitHub Pages path/directory errors (needs to be discussed, cannot be decided by myself - Index since I'm not the owner of the repository)
- [ ] Merging PolyCode tutorials and these tutorials together
- [ ] Making homepage featured games automatically fetched based off popular games using Polytoria public API
